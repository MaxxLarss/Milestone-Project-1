# Milestone-Project-1
## Project Description
I want to create a tic tac toe game. The game is a solo game of a 3x3 grid that equals to 9 spaces. The player will place the X or O into 
the destignated spot.

## Game Logic
1. The game will consist of 9 open squares.
2. The player clicks the open spaces to place a X or O.
3. Inorder to win the game, the player has to have a x or O that is a three in a row, wether it is horizotal, vertical, or diagonal.
4. If there is no three in a row, then the game is a draw.

## MVP Critera
 1. The player must be able to get 3 in a row of X or O
 2. The lets the player know who wins or if it is a tie

## Post-MVP Plans
1. Have the grid open instead of being squares
